NOTE: Opening the website on a non live-server or 
without using a code editor such as VSCode would
deactivate the some links to be navigated due to the
code implemented there that are live-server dependent.
Therefore, manually opening this website will not 100%
function.

Put the example codes on an Anchor Tag's href like base on its medium : <a href=""></a>

1.)Example Code: (Manual, Non live-server dependent)
- C:\Users\toshiba\OneDrive\Documents\FRONT-END PROJECTS\Kiddie_WEBPARK\T&C\terms.html

2.)Example Code: (Live server, Code Editor)
- /T&C/terms.html

No issues will be found if you are opening the website inside a code editor or using
live server as it will completely implement the original code.
But using the website and opening it directly on a computer's My Library locally and 
manually will occur an error navigating a webpage.
